About SympleQ
===========

| **SympleQ** (Quantum Algorithms on Stabilizers) is a unified framework that consolidates our established quantum-inspired algorithms into a cohesive, extensible platform designed to support researchers and accelerate future developments. 
| SympleQ primarily focuses on classically efficient, quantum-inspired techniques, leveraging tools such as stabilizer states, the Clifford group, and graph theory to approach quantum computing problems from novel, tractable perspectives. 

**Applications include:**

* Simplifying Hamiltonians
* Efficient preparation of graph states

These algorithms build on a foundation of prior research and are integrated into a modular system that allows 
for continuous growth and improvement.

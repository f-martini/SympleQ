   `Visual Studio Code Extensions <development/extensions.html>`_), automatically
   detect PEP 8 violations highlighting them in the editor as warnings
   and providing suggestions to fix them.

This page provides a collection of resources to help you with the development of QuAOS and the surrounding ecosyst.
